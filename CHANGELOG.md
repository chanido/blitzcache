- **Auto-detection of Application Names**: Intelligent application identification with custom override support

### Changed
- Enhanced `IServiceCollectionExtensions` with logging configuration options
- Improved test coverage with logging functionality examples
- Updated comprehensive test suite to 128 tests
- **Updated CI/CD pipeline to .NET 8.0** - No longer supports .NET 6.0 in build pipeline for better security and performance
